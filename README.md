# Mines3D
Minesweeper on n*m*2 matrix for Android. The goal of the game is find the all of mines and mark them by long press. This is probably impossible without dicovering empty fields. When you double-tap on field without a mine[x,y,z], you shall get the number of mines in fields (if exists) [(x-1),y,z], [(x+1),y,z], [x,(y-1),z], [x,(y+1),z], [x, y, (z+1) mod 1].
